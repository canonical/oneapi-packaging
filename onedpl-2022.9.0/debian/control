Description: oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL)
  oneDPL is part of the UXL Foundation and is an implementation of the oneAPI
  specification for the oneDPL component. oneDPL works with the IntelÂ® oneAPI 
  DPC++/C++ Compiler to provide high-productivity APIs to developers, which can
  minimize Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) programming efforts across devices for high
  performance parallel applications.
