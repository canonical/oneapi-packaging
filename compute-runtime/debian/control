Description: Intel oneAPI L0 support implementation for Intel GPUs -- shared library
 Implementation for the Intel GPUs of the oneAPI L0 specification - which
 provides direct-to-metal interfaces to offload accelerator devices. Its
 programming interface can be tailored to any device needs and can be
 adapted to support broader set of languages features such as function
 pointers, virtual functions, unified memory, and I/O capabilities.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
